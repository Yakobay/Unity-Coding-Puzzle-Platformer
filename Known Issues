Issues/bugs:

1. Compiled game does not function properly unless run with 1920x1200 resolution and "fantastic" graphics settings.
2. Removing or replacing movement or loop symbols in-game has inconsistent results
3. Second platform intereferes with player's ability to use first platform and may pass through the first platform as if it is not there.
4. Player sometimes gets stuck on the edge of a platform.

Other notable problems (resulting from the game being incomplete):

1. No levels past the first exist or function properly since they were not worked on beyond implementing the function of having the player 
   move between levels.
2. The Enemy (the small white box) has no texture or real function as of yet.
3. There are several scripts which have no function in the current state of the prototype, which exist because of aspects of the game 
   which have been removed or are yet to be added.
4. Prototype.exe cannot be exited from in-game. If on a Windows computer, you must use the Windows key and close the application.
5. There are no instructions or title screens in the game yet.
