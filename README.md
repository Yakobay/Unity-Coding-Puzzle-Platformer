# Unity Coding Puzzle Platformer
Game is a work in progress. It has many bugs.
Prototype.exe (which contains the game) should not be run without Unity.dll and Prototype_Data folder
Prototype.exe should be run with a 1920x1200 resolution and "Fantastic" graphics settings in order for it to function properly.
